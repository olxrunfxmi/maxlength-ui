        <p>Beauty can sometimes be hard to see. Often, form takes precedence over it, especially in a result (profit)
            driven world.
            What works? Whatâ€™s driving value? How much is it worth? We quickly forget much of what we do is not in the
            outcomes, but
            in the process. It makes us forget the beauty in the mundane process that leads to the outcomes. So, we lack
            refinement,
            adjustment, obsession over details, and expressiveness because of the euphoria of the result.</p>

        <div class="input-area area-1">
            <textarea name="" id="" maxlength="320">What do you think about beauty?</textarea>
            <div class="circle-indicator"></div>
            <button class="btn type-1">send thought</button>
        </div>
        <div class="input-area area-1">
            <textarea class="area-1" name="" id="" maxlength="320">What do you think about beauty?</textarea>
            <div class="circle-indicator"></div>
            <div class="input-info">
                <p>Make a post, would you?</p>
            </div>
            <button class="btn type-1">send thought</button>
        </div>

        <p>What does the future holds for us? That's the very question that drives what we do in the present. We want
            some
            semblance of assurance that what we are doing today will protects tomorrow. Be it our jobs, family,
            relationships, we
            want some form of certainty. We are threatened by things that bring uncertainty and sometimes fail to
            embrace the beauty
            in those things. We shouldn't just blindly accept things, absolutely, but we shouldn't interact with
            uncertain things
            from a place of fear.</p>

        <div class="input-area area-2">
            <textarea name="" id="">What do you think about future?</textarea>
            <button class="btn type-2">send thought</button>
        </div>
        <div class="input-area area-2">
            <textarea name="" id="" class="full">What do you think about future?</textarea>
            <button class="btn type-2">send thought</button>
        </div>

        <p>Everyone is baseline smart. Often, people think they are dumb because they don't have the prerequisite
            knowledge to what
            they are currently learning or interacting with. So, when next you are learning something new (say physics)
            or
            interacting with a new information (a tweet/blog with complexity), ask yourself, do I have the prerequisite?
            if No, it's
            time to learn something new. Never, ever, think you are dumb. Just look at AIs, they have to use billions of
            clear and
            concise parameters to make them seem smart. You only process probably less than 1% of those parameters and
            you can do
            crazy things.</p>

        <p>these are just fun things to build as I learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That's a navbar and these are
            textarea with
            maxlength indicators. I know it's simple stuff, but simple stuff are part of big stuff</p>
